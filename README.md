# Attendance Management Project

This is a Java-based project developed as part of Kalvium's Object Oriented Programming course (SPE 2025). The goal of this project is to build an attendance system using OOP principles.

## Getting Started

To run this project:

1. Compile the code: `javac src\com\school\Main.java`
2. Run the code: `java -cp src com.school.Main`


## Part 2 - Core Domain Modelling

- Added `Student` and `Course` classes with constructors and display methods.
- Created arrays of students and courses.
- Printed their details using `Main.java`.


## Part 3: Constructor Initialization & Auto-ID Generation
- Implemented parameterized constructors in `Student` and `Course` classes for object initialization.
- Utilized `private static` member variables for automatic and unique ID generation.
- Demonstrated the use of the `this` keyword to distinguish instance variables from constructor parameters.
- Changed `Course`'s `courseId` to `int` for simpler auto-generation and updated its display.
- Updated `Main.java` to use constructors and show ID progression.

### How to Run (ensure this is up-to-date)
